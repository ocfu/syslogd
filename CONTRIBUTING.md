- Write clear and concise comments where necessary.

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- Be specific about the changes made.

### Pull Requests
- Reference relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #42").
- Ensure your changes are tested and do not break existing functionality.
- Provide context for your changes in the pull request description.

## 🧪 Testing
- Include tests for any new features or fixes.
- Run all tests locally before submitting your pull request:
  - `make` builds all three binaries cleanly (no warnings with `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`).
  - Start the server, send a message with `syslogd_client`, then verify it appears in the log file.
  - Check the web viewer renders the log at `http://localhost:8090/`.
